        Why do I need to register my business?
        <span class="icon icon--arrow">
          <i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </span>
      </summary>
      <p>Here are some reasons why you should register your business:</p>
      <p>- It is a legal requirement by the Government of Trinidad & Tobago.</p>
      <p>- You'll be able to declare tax-deductible business expenses.</p>
      <p>- Being unregistered prohibits you from growing, since you'll have to avoid being noticed by the Government.</p>
      <p>- Banks only allow registered businesses to open an account, which you would need in order to accept cheque and linx transactions.</p>
      <p>- Unregistered businesses cannot do business with legitimate businesses.</p>
      <p>- Only registered businesses can bid on government tenders.</p>
      <p>- If unregistered, another person can register the name that you operate under and prohibit you from doing further business under that name.</p>
      <p>- If you Trade under a business name that even resembles one that has been registered, expect a "cease and desist" letter from their lawyer.</p>
